			Hello everyone! I am Mr. Ma, I am a teacher of Ontario, currently working at RGSS. This is my
			short exemplar website to demonstrate to my Grade 11 computer science class what it would look
			like to be successful in their assignment. I hope they take a detailed look at all the
			exemplars in order to achieve a good grade on this assignment. In order to fully analyze every
			aspect, they should make use of the dev tools and the code for the website.

			Below is a short list of the day to day hobbies that I have. Obviously, as a teacher, I don't

		<p>Below is a short table outlining the subjects I teach.</p>

		<table>
			<tbody>
				<!--My Science Teachables-->
				<tr>
					<td class="subject-titles">Science</td>
					<td>
						<ul class="table-list">
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								General Science
								<ul>
									Honestly, one of my favourite subjects to teach. It's always enjoyable to
									introduce students to the world of science.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Biology
								<ul>
									Probably my least favourite science topic. Doesn't mean I don't love it. I mean,
									one of them has to be my least favourite.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Chemistry
								<ul>
									The subject I've taught the most and therefore, is probably the one I am most
									familiar with. This is also what I specialized in University.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Physics
								<ul>
									This is probably tied neck and neck with Chemistry for my favourite science.
									However, I do admit this is probably my weakest area of science.
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>

				<!--My Math Teachables-->
				<tr>
					<td class="subject-titles">Math</td>
					<td>
						<ul class="table-list">
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Math
								<ul>
									Teaching math is fun. Although, I do understand the n-th time a student has to
									hear me say y=mx+b or the quadratic equation can get annoying.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Functions
								<ul>
									This is probably the leading reason why I landed my first job, as a tutor. I
									tutored this subject for years. Although, it's also been years since I've tutored
									it.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Calculus
								<ul>
									Students always either love this, or hate this. Rarely a middle ground. It's the
									basis of all modern science and mathematics.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Data Management
								<ul>
									I think everyone should take this. It may be difficult but the contents are very
									applicable to real life.
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>

				<!--My Comp Sci Teachables-->
				<tr>
					<td class="subject-titles">Comp Sci</td>
					<td>
						<ul class="table-list">
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Javascript | HTML | CSS
								<ul>
									The languages I'm most familiar with. Technically, I specialize in a more specific
									type of Javascript called JSX which is utilized by the dominant library, React by
									Facebook.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="table-list-headings">
								Python
								<ul>
									A very well rounded language. Although, that wasn't really it's intended purpose.
									Sometimes, I feel like modern python is a bit of a chimera. Everyone wants to use
									it for anything but that might not always to optimal.
								</ul>
							</li>
