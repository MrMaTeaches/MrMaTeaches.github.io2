		<p>
			Hello everyone! I am Mr. Ma, I am a teacher of Ontario, currently working at RGSS. This is my
			short exemplar website to demonstrate to my Grade 11 computer science class what it would look
			like to be successful in their assignment. I hope they take a detailed look at all the
			exemplars in order to achieve a good grade on this assignment. In order to fully analyze every
			aspect, they should make use of the dev tools and the code for the website.
